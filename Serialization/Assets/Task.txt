Make an incredibly simple game
Have it load and save during runtime using three different methods of serialization. JSON, XML, and Binary.
Answer the bonus questions marked by Q. throughout the project for the final 9%

Game:
Bounded level
Summon a bunch of random colored squares
circles move randomly within a bounded level
circles that touch squares will destroy the square and consume the color.

Make is so you can save and load the level, keeping the positions and colors of all objects using JSON,XML and Binary

PlayerPrefs:
Make an editor window with two int fields
	Number of Square
	Number of Circles
When the game loads, it creates that many
