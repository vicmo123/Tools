How to download JSONCONVERTER for notepad++ so you can view the jsons in a readable format
The save files will be in a format not very readable by people, but can be with this plugin to notepad++

Step 1) Download:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/nppjsonviewer/files/latest/download
Step 2) Place the .dll into Notepad++/Plugins folder   (For me: C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins)
Step 3) Close and re-open notepad++
Step 4)there might be a warning saying "incompatible version" or whatever, just say yes to remove, and some reason itll work and still be there
Step 5) In notepad++, there is a Plugins tab, in there JSONVIEWER, with all the text selected (ctrl+a) select Format json, should show the json in proper way
